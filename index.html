            <p style="border-style: ridge; padding: 10px">Completed the Hextech hammer today. While I was hoping to never create a weapon using Hextech, I feel it is necessary to combat the current situation. Hopefully this will be the only one I ever have to create.</p>

            <p style="border-style: ridge; padding: 10px">Heimerdinger no longer counsillor! During our great leaders daily meeting, it was voted that Heimerdinger was to step down from the council in favor of the young Jayce Talis. Talis is expected to head the security division as well as the research and development department. Does the "Man of Progress" have what it takes to lead? </p>
